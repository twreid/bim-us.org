# History of the Bible Institute of Missouri
For many years, it has been the desire of the **_Kansas Expressway_** congregation to establish a program of advanced Biblical studies not only for the training of gospel preachers but to aid brethren who seek to study the Bible in-depth.

Most members of the church recognize the need for trained preachers, leaders and membership. There is always a need for more schools where one can receive advanced training and instruction in Biblical studies throughout the United States, especially in mid-America. Many have rightfully said that there cannot be too many schools offering quality instruction and training for those who seek to know Godâ€™s Word better and to communicate that Word to others.

The leadership and members of the **_Kansas Expressway church of Christ_** are fully committed to seeing that the **_Bible Institute of Missouri_** becomes a strong force for the advancement of the cause of Christ throughout the United States and the world. A new facility has been built to accommodate the school. Several men, young and old, have expressed a desire to be a part of the school. Graduates are now laboring in the vineyard of the Lord.

The elders invited brother J. R. Sullins to establish and direct the **_Bible Institute of Missouri_**. He is a graduate of Harding University. For the past 40 plus years brother Sullins has been a preacher of the gospel. While in the United States he served congregations in Arkansas, Tennessee, Indiana, and Alabama. He and his family were missionaries to Kenya, East Africa from 1979-1981. Since 1987, brother Sullins has established, directed, and taught at the Botswana and Zambia Schools of Biblical Studies.

The **_Bible Institute of Missouri_** began its first class on August 25th, 2003. We request your prayers and support for this effort. If you know anyone who would be interested in information concerning the school, please give them this information and encourage them to send for further details.

May God richly bless you all,

The Elders - Kansas Expressway Church of Christ
