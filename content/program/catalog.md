### Purpose
The **Bible Institute of Missouri** has been established for the purpose of training men to be proclaimers of God's Word throughout the United States and the world. The school recognizes the need for training institutions that are affordable to those who may not have the means to attend a college or university. Also, the great need for faithful gospel preachers in the brotherhood has brought about the establishment of the **Bible Institute of Missouri**. Another great purpose of this school is to provide extension courses to help take care of the need for more teaching and training in the Lord's church. The **Bible Institute of Missouri** is open to all who desire to gain further Bible knowledge and/or to become full-time gospel preachers. The school will make every effort to maintain the highest standard in teachers, students and academics.

__________

### Academic Standing
The **Bible Institute of Missouri** offers the equivalent or 139 semester hours in Bible and related subjects, it must be remembered that the Bible Institute of Missouri is operated by and for churches of Christ. Outside agencies conferring academic status or recognition are of little value to such schools because they lack a proper appreciation for the aims and purposes of preacher training schools. The two-year program is equivalent to that of a four-year college program. The school is conducted on a college level of instruction.

The school does have a graduation service and awards a *"Degree of Biblical Studies"* to those who successfully complete the work. Graduates of the **Bible Institute of Missouri** will be respected for their abilities and preparation, and will be the equal of any worker for the Lord in the world.

### Class Attendance
Each student is expected to be in his respective class on time at every session as scheduled. All necessary tardies and absences must be arranged with the director and respective instructors and are to be governed by the following:

**Leave of Absence.** Such is granted to students under conditions that are beyond their control, such as road hazards, weather conditions, sickness, death in the immediate family, necessary official business and representing the school.

**Absences and Class Cuts.** No absence is permitted, except as indicated in the above paragraph. No class cuts are excused. Each case will be reviewed by the director and faculty committee. Anyone whose attendance is determined unsatisfactory will be dismissed. Appointments with doctors and dentists should be made for after school or on Saturdays.

**Tardies.** Being late to chapel and classes will not be tolerated. Three tardies equal one unexcused absence; three unexcused absences subject one to dismissal. Anyone habitually tardy for classes at anytime (at the beginning of class or after break) is to be refused admittance to class and readmitted only after permission from the director is granted.

For each unexcused absence, the student's final grade average will be reduced five points. A written reason for each tardy or absence must be presented to the instructor. Unsatisfactory attendance will be reported to the director.

**Make-up work.** Each student is held accountable for work missed due to absence for any reason and will be required to make it up, according to the demands of his respective instructor. In view of the intensive work and accelerated program of this school, any student missing as much as two weeks total in any one session may be asked to withdraw. He may re-enter in a later term.in the world.

Students are responsible for raising their own support. This can come by selling property or using savings accounts.
