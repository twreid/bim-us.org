# Facility of the Bible Institute of Missouri

The **_Bible Institute of Missouri_** was so named to indicate an institute of higher learning set up for those who are interested in studying God's Word. It is located in Springfield, Missouri, which is in the southwest part of the state at the foot of the Ozark Mountains. Springfield is a city of 152,000 with a metro population above 380,000. It is the third largest city in the state of Missouri and is ranked among the top five cities in the nation as a great place to raise a family. Springfield has a healthy job market, great schools, superior health care facilities, and an active arts community with warm and friendly people.

The **_Bible Institute of Missouri_** is housed in a separate facility behind the building of the Kansas Expressway church of Christ. Within the facility are offices, classrooms, a library, and a break room. It is a modern facility with a wireless computer network for students and faculty. The facility was completed in 2003 for the purpose of housing the school. It is located about a half mile south of Interstate 44 and is convenient to the Springfield-Branson National Airport and to shopping. In fact, it is close enough to Kansas Expressway to have easy access to the city, but far enough away to be quiet and undisturbed.

A religious research library is located at the school facility. Also a new Springfield public library is just across the street from the school which gives our students access to extensive research facilities. The school library has computers with online research capabilities. The library of the late Emerson J. Estes of the Memphis, Tennessee area was donated to the school. Brother Estes was one of the great preachers of his generation and was known for his faithfulness and love for the truth.
